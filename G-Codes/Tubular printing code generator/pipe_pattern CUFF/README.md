# MEW_G-code_generator
This is a guide to use the python G-code generartor for MEWron tubular collector. The tool is based on Voron 0.1 design with the addition of a tubular collector with a Klipper firmware and an Octoprint user interface. 
1. The first step is to clone the python code onto your computer. There are multiple way to do so:
     - **Git Clone**: You should know the basics of git in order to use this. You open a terminal on your computer and run in a specified folder:                                    `git clone https://github.com/azedgitt/MEW_G-code_generator.git`
        This will download the code in the folder with the git history. This method allows to edit the software and track the new changes with git as well as keeping the               past changes.
     - **Open with Github Desktop**: This require the app to be installed on your computer. This functions the same way as Git Clone. The main advantage is to have a nice           user interface to observe the results than a computer terminal. 
     - **Download ZIP**: This method downloads all the files of the branch as a zip. The files need to be extracted before use. The main disadvantage of this method is that         you only get the files without the history or the full branches of the project. **Beware currently the main branch only contains ideas of possible upgrades to the              software, the functional code is on the `master` branch**.
   Now that the software is available on your computer, it is ready to use.

2. The next step is to adapt the constants to your system. In order to do so, the `constants.py` file should be opened before starting to edit the values:

| Constant name | description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| FULL_REVOLUTION | The value should correspond to a full revolution of the shaft. This value should never change once measured unless the printer.cfg file is changed. The value can be tested using the terminal inside octoprint: MANUAL_STEPPER=stepper_name MOVE=FULL_REVOLUTION SPEED=speed ACCEL=MANDREL_ACCEL SYNC=0  |
| MANDREL_ACCEL |  This value is the equal to the maximum accelerartion allowed to be applied by the motor to the shaft. The value can be found in the klipper config file on the printer: `printer.cfg`  |
| LAYER_HEIGHT  | When printing multiple layer, the print head should increase the distance to maintain good MEW properties. For prints that are under or equal to 5 layer z offset isn't required. For larger prints, it is recommended to increase the height each layer. **Beware that with a height change to voltage needs to change.** This value should take approximately the value of the diameter of the fiber.  |
| TEMPERATURE  | This value is the melting temperature of the used polymer.  |
| FLOWRATE| This value is a measure how much material is extruded in Î¼g/s. This value is used to compute the wait time in the print.|
|DENSITY | This is density of the material used in g/cm^3|
|OFFSET | The value is a distance to move the print head safely at the end of a print.  |
|FILE_NAME| The name given to the output g-code file takes the following form :FILE_NAME.gcode |
|v_x| The translational speed of the print head along the shaft axis. It is given in mm/min.|
|v_theta_init| In order to addhere the polymer to the mandrel before stabilising, the shaft is rotated a this speed. On our system this value is very low (0.25).|
|R_MANDREL| This is the radius of the shaft that is used inside your system. | 

It doesn't matter what text editor is used a this stage.

3. The third step is to prepare the pattern for the print. The `main.py` file contains the required parameters for the toolpath generation. Each pattern is defined as a repeating unit of a certain length that can be repeated a certain number of times. The number of layers gives the number of stacking fibers, with an z-offset that is given by LAYER_HEIGHT. The distance in between each fiber is given by spacing.

| Constant name | description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|length| This is the length of the repeating unit in mm. **The total length of the pattern is given by length x repetitions.** |
| repetitions | This is the number of repeating patterns to produce a longer sample. |
| layers | This is the number of fiber that are stacked on top of each other.  |
| spacing | This is the distance between the fibers. |
| author | The name of the person who generated the gcode. |
| today | The time stamps at which the gcode file was generated.  |
| pattern | This is the pattern that will be printed. The first option is "tube", the fibre is deposited in a spiral pattern around the shaft, in a stent like pattern. The following layers are printed using the same toolpath then the first layer. The second option is a "pipe" pattern, two types of layers are alterning: straight fibers and tube fibers. The layer is defined as an alternating pair and starts with the straight fibers. The third option is channel, this pattern is the layering of straight fibres that is wrapped by a tube pattern for stability. The last option currently is the custom. The programmer has complete control on the pattern that is produced at the end, from the starting pattern, to the variations in the patterns. **This option should be used by seasoned users.**  |
| starting_position | This is the position at which the fiber should start to adhere to the rod.  |
| stabilisation_pos | This position is the starting position of the stabilisation pattern. This section is very important it enables the fibre to stabilise and be deposited in a uniform way. |
|init_position | This position is where the required pattern is going to print. Each g-code command will be compute in absolute coordinates with respect to this value for the pattern.|
| end_pos | This is the position at which the printhead leaves the shaft to go toward the safety position. |
| safety_pos | This position is defined a safe position to manipulate the shaft without getting burned once the high voltage is removed. This value should change with the user's particular system.|

4. Once the files are edited and save the next step is to compile and run the software to generate the g-code file. The terminal is the easisest method. Open a terminal inside the folder that constains the python code and type : `python main.py` if this should not work try `python3 main.py`. This step assumes that python is already installed, if not the instruction for the installation is available here : `https://www.python.org/downloads/ ` Once the code finished running, a gcode file should appear in the folder. **Beware, if the file name is not changed, then the file is overwritten.**

5. The g-code is finally ready to be uploaded to the print. The file can be dragged and dropped to Octoprint.

6. Before printing, the nozzle should be preheated to the correct temperature. Once the feed rate is set, then the polymer should extrude nicely under the action of the high voltage. Once the polymer consistently flows from the nozzle then the print can be start. From octoprint, just select the file and click on the printer incon to start the print.
