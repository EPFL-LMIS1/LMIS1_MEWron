# Tubular collector MEWron

Here you can find the files needed to recreate a tubular collector MEWron printer like the ones present at LIMS1@EPFL. We do our best to keep an eye on this but refer for questions to the authors of the corresponding publications.

Before starting to build a tubular MEWron, please refer to the other sections on building a MEWron with a flat collector.

If you use the files in this repository for scientific work, we kindly ask you to cite this repository and any publications listed here:

Here you can find all the stl. files that needed to be print in order to build a tubular MEWron. For printing guidelines, please refer to the Voron manual.
Furthermore, you can find a 3D model of the assembled printer in these files.
The tubular printer was developed during a semester project at the Swiss Federal institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne. The pdf report can be found in this repository as well as here: https://infoscience.epfl.ch/handle/20.500.14299/241044 

In the model, you can see that the more isolated printbed from the original MEWron paper is being used. In our lab, we decided to use the stock printbed, without issues regarding eclectic arcing.
