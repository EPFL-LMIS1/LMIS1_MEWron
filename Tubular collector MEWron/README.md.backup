# Tubular collector MEWron

Here you can find the files needed to recreate a tubular collector MEWron printer like the ones present at LIMS1@EPFL. We do our best to keep an eye on this but refer for questions to the authors of the corresponsing publications.

Before starting to build a tubular MEWron, please refer to the other sections on building a MEWron with a flat collector.

If you use the files in this repository for scientific work, we kindly ask you to cite this respository and any publications listed here: 

"Performance Comparison of Shape Memory Polymer Structures Printed by Fused Deposition Modeling and Melt Electrowriting" https://doi.org/10.1002/admt.202400466
