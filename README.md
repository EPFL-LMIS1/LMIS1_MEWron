# LMIS1_MEWron

This respository contains files to recreate the MEWron printers present at LIMS1@EPFL. We do our best to keep an eye on this but refer for questions to the authors of the corresponsing publications. The MEWron is based on the following publication: 

__MEWron: An open-source melt electrowriting platform__

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2023.103604

Ander Reizabal, Taavet Kangur, Paula G. Saiz, Sönke Menke, Christophe Moser, Jürgen Brugger, Paul D. Dalton, Simon Luposchainsky

Additive Manufacturing, Volume 71, 2023, 103604, ISSN 2214-860.

### [Flat collector MEWron](https://github.com/EPFL-LMIS1/LMIS1_MEWron/blob/main/Flat%20collector%20MEWron)

Here you can find all information on how to build and set-up your own MEWron with a flat collector. You can also find and image file that you can flash onto a new SD card to see how we set up the printer.


### [Tubular collector MEWron](https://github.com/EPFL-LMIS1/LMIS1_MEWron/blob/main/Tubular%20collector%20MEWron)

Here you can find all information on how to upgrade your existing flat collector MEWron with a tubular collector. You can also find and image file that you can flash onto a new SD card to see how we set up the printer.

### [G-Codes and Code generator](https://github.com/EPFL-LMIS1/LMIS1_MEWron/blob/main/G-Codes)

Here you can find phython scripts to generate your own G-codes as well as some premade ones.
