# LMIS1_MEWron

This respository contains files to recreate the MEWron printers present at LIMS1@EPFL. We do our best to keep an eye on this but refer for questions to the authors of the corresponsing publications. The MEWron is based on the following publication: 

MEWron: An open-source melt electrowriting platform

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2023.103604

Ander Reizabal, Taavet Kangur, Paula G. Saiz, Sönke Menke, Christophe Moser, Jürgen Brugger, Paul D. Dalton, Simon Luposchainsky

Additive Manufacturing, Volume 71, 2023, 103604, ISSN 2214-860.
