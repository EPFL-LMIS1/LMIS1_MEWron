# Flat Collector MEWron

Here you can find the files needed to recreate a flat collector MEWron printer like the ones present at LIMS1@EPFL. We do our best to keep an eye on this but refer for questions to the authors of the corresponsing publications.

For an instruction on how to build the MEWron, please see here:
